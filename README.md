# Two-component-eGPE-for-Dipolar-Mixtures_Different-Dipoles


eGPE solver for two-component dipolar mixtures, incorporating the LHY correction. See https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.025301 Prerequisite step before running this script is to run the notebook "tabulating_lhy.ipynb" in order to obtain LHY energy and chemical potentials.
